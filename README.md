In this assignment, I didn’t make any big structural changes because my previous version was already pretty complete. Instead, I focused on smaller aspects. I added more detail to the overall setup, organized my scripts better, and commented the code to make it easier to read.

The main new feature I implemented was a high score system. Now, whenever the player breaks the record, a message appears on the screen to celebrate the achievement. This small addition makes the game feel more rewarding and gives the player a sense of progress.

Here, there are some snippets of my game and the main scripts:

The rest of the scripts are in the scenes folder.

Looking forward, I think what the game still needs to feel like a more complete and engaging product is some form of coin system. That would give the player an extra goal beyond just surviving, and a reason to keep playing to improve their score and earn coins.
